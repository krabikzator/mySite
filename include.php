<h1>Everyone in The United Kingdom can participate.</h1>
<p>Since we travel often, we have already got used to collecting backpacks so as not to regret the extra pounds behind our backs. In this article we will give you the minimum things we take for rest - regardless of whether it is a long journey or a short one. We will also tell you about some of the highlights and give you advice on how to pack your things and not forget anything before your trip.</p>

<p>Lifehack: Do not connect to an insecure public network, but rather use a VPN. All public networks in hotels, hostels, cafes, shopping malls, etc. should be considered unsafe.</p>

<h1>Do some more seal spotting</h1>

<p>If the seals at Seal Bay Conservation Park don’t cut it for you – venture east to Admiral’s Arch, which you will find located in Cape du Couedic, Flinders Chase National Park. At this eccentric location, you can enjoy the luxury of watching seals swim and play in their natural environment, viewable through a rock arch masterfully sculpted by the wind and sea over time. On the other side of the portal, 7,000 or so New Zealand fur seals will be your entertainers for the day.</p>

<p>Visiting a subterranean wonderland of underground caverns and plunging sinkholes probably isn’t for everyone – particularly if you start feeling sick at the mention that some of them dip a good 5.5 miles below the earth. If you can conquer the claustrophobic feelings though, taking one of Kelly Hill’s guided tours of the magnificent limestone formation is a must.</p>

<p>The more adventurous types can test their mettle by crawling through an underground maze of smaller caverns.</p>

<h1>Capturing the first rays</h1>

<p>Featuring the world’s largest collection of hoodoos – wind-eroded sandstone formations – Bryce Canyon resembles a series of rocky skyscrapers from afar. Take in the new day with the vantage points offered by the Rim Trail, or head to the aptly named Sunrise Point for striking views of the entire canyon. It’ll be busy, but there’s enough room that you won’t have to jostle for space – just try to find a spot with a view over the western side of the canyon.</p>

<p>In this case, no need to set an alarm in Tulum, just follow the sun worshippers that gather at the shoreline daily to watch the sun rise. The coastal oasis of Tulum draws spiritual travelers year-round to watch the sun break past the horizon in front of the cliff-side Mayan ruins of Zama, the City of Dawn. Take a second to rip your eyes away from the ocean sunrise to see, behind you, the morning light paint El Castillo temple’s ruins in light orange hues.</p>

<h1>Druids and pagans celebrating</h1>

<p>What better place to view a sunrise than a monument widely thought to have been built to celebrate the sun? Book ahead if you want to be able to walk within the perimeter of this ancient stone circle – and get there as early as possible to take in the changing light. Every sunrise at Stonehenge is breathtaking (if the weather allows), but there’s nothing like the sunrises of the solstices, when the sun lines up perfectly with the massive stone trilithon.</p>

<p>All red sand and rock formations, Wadi Rum resembles Mars so closely that a film where Matt Damon goes on a mission to the Red Planet was filmed here. Explore the sandstone and granite valley in a four-wheel drive or on camel-back, and watch the sands and looming rock formations turn pink and purple as the sunrise paints the sky. If early morning travel isn’t your thing, consider bivouacking (camping sans tent) for the night – the starscape over the desert is otherworldly.</p>

<h1>Bird’s eye view</h1>

<p>A sunrise here is like no other, but you’ll have to cross your fingers that the sun creeps out from behind the clouds. Overcast mornings are common, so be patient and wait for the grey skies to dissipate: seeing the sun’s rays slowly reveal this historic stone city and its surrounding snow-capped mountains is part of the joy.</p>

<p>Inca Trail hikers – and let’s face it, most visitors here are – will generally reach the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu and its famed views on the fourth day of their trip, but you can also venture pretty close up by bus from the nearby town of Aguas Calientes.</p>
